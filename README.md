## 1) A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners:-

This project explores the trends and demographics of Nobel Prize winners from 1901 to 2016 using a dataset containing information such as birth country, sex, category of prize, and year of award. The analysis reveals shifts in Nobel Prize dominance, from Eurocentrism to the increasing influence of the United States, as well as gender disparities across prize categories. Notable findings include the rise of the USA as the most common birth country of laureates, the significant imbalance between male and female winners, and the increasing average age of recipients over time. Additionally, the project highlights remarkable individuals, such as Marie Curie and Malala Yousafzai, who made history as the first woman and the youngest recipient of the Nobel Prize, respectively. Through visualizations and data exploration, this project provides insights into the evolving landscape of Nobel laureates and their contributions to society.
